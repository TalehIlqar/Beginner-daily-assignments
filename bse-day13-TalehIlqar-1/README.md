# Assignments' list 

## Assignment 1  :star:  :star:

### Description

**Selectable list**

Create a list where elements are selectable, like in file-managers.

* A click on a list element selects only that element (adds the class ```.selected```), deselects all others.
* If a click is made with **Ctrl** (**Cmd** for Mac), then the selection is toggled on the element, but other elements are not modified.

## Assignment 2  :star:  :star:  :star:

### Description

**Improved tooltip behavior**

Write JavaScript that shows a tooltip over an element with the attribute ```data-tooltip```. The value of this attribute should become the tooltip text.

That’s like the task Tooltip behavior, but here the annotated elements can be nested. The most deeply nested tooltip is shown.

Only one tooltip may show up at the same time. 
For instance: 

```
<div data-tooltip="Here – is the house interior" id="house">
  <div data-tooltip="Here – is the roof" id="roof"></div>
  ...
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Little_Pigs" data-tooltip="Read on…">Hover over me</a>
</div>

```

### Description

Create an endless page. When a visitor scrolls it to the end, it auto-appends current date-time to the text (so that a visitor can scroll more).

## Assignment 4  :star:  :star:  :star:

### Description

Create a “to the top” button to help with page scrolling.

It should work like this:

* While the page is not scrolled down at least for the window height – it’s invisible.
* When the page is scrolled down more than the window height – there appears an “upwards” arrow in the left-top corner. If the page is scrolled back, it disappears.
* When the arrow is clicked, the page scrolls to the top.
