# Assignments' list 

## Assignment 1  :star:  :star:

### Description

1) We ask the user the name of the product

   name =?

2) We ask the user the price of the goods

   price =?

3) We ask the user the weight of the goods

   weight =?

4) We ask the user for the discount (in percent)

   discount =?

5) Calculate the total cost of the goods

   summary =? 


Print the amount to be paid with an **alert**


***Formula:*** product price x weight of goods - discount percentage

***Don't forget*** - convert to price, weight, discount to number

## Assignment 2  :star:  :star:  :star:

### Description

Your program should ask the user to record the amount of gasoline in **gallons**. Then you have to print it by making the following calculations:

* How many liters does it take?
* How many barrels does it take?
* What is the amount of CO2?
* What is the energy value of a gallon of ethanol?
* What is the price in dollars?

Make your calculations using the following information:

* 1 gallon of gasoline is equal to 3.7854 liters
* 1 barrel of gasoline is equal to 19.5 gallons (this figure depends on the source of oil. The exact figure is not important for this task)
* Approximately 20 pounds of CO2 is released from 1 gallon of gasoline
* 1 gallon of gasoline produces 115,000 BTU (British Thermal Units). 1 gallon of ethanol produces 75,700 BTU.
* No one knows the price of gasoline in dollars :) But let's assume that it is $ 4.00 / gallon.

## Assignment 3  :star:  :star:  :star:

### Description

Your program should calculate the energy of the earthquakes recorded on the Richter scale below with a coil, as well as how many tons of TNT bursts.

* 9.1 (Indonesian earthquake, 2004)
* 9.2 (Alaska Earthquake, 1964)
* 9.5 (Chile earthquake, 1960; the strongest earthquake in history)

Your program must then enter numbers from the user at random Richter scale (the fraction can be numeric), and your program must compare this number with both Coil and TNT weights.

#### Assignment Notes

* Energy released during a 1-magnitude earthquake with a Richter scale: Energy = 10 ** (1.5 * richter + 4.8)
* The energy released when 1 ton of TNT explodes is equal to 4.184 * 10 ** 6 coils
