# Assignments' list 

## Assignment 1  :star:  :star:

### Description

Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.

Sample Output
```
"0 is even"
"1 is odd"
"2 is even"
"3 is odd"

## Assignment 2  :star:  :star:  :star:

### Description

Write a JavaScript program to find the armstrong numbers of 3 digits.

**Note:** An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. 

For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since ```3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371```
